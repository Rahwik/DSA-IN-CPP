Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
=====================================

Introduction to DSA
-------------------

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science.

They provide efficient ways to organize and process data, solving problems effectively.

Asymptotic Notations
====================

Big O Notation (O)
------------------

Represents an upper bound or exact bound.

`O(f(n))` denotes an upper limit on the growth rate of a function.

Theta Notation (Θ)
------------------

Represents an exact bound.

`Θ(f(n))` denotes a tight bound on the growth rate of a function.

Omega Notation (Ω)
------------------

Represents an exact or lower bound.

`Ω(f(n))` denotes a lower limit on the growth rate of a function.

Comparison of Notations
-----------------------

Big O is used to describe the upper bound, Theta provides a tight bound, and Omega represents the lower bound.

Direct Ways to Reduce Order of Growth
-------------------------------------

*   Ignore lower-order terms.
*   Ignore leading constants.

Comparison of Terms
-------------------

The order of growth from smaller to larger:

`c < loglogn < logn < n1/3 < n1/2 < n < n2 < n3 < 2n`
