1.Order of Growth:

Function f(n) is said to be growing faster than g(n) if:

 lim   f(n)/g(n) = ∞
 n->∞ 
 OR
 lim   g(n)/f(n) = 0
 n->∞ 

 A fast growing function is unpreferable

Suppose, f(n) = n^2 + n +6
         g(n) = 2n + 5

        lim   2n+5/n^2 + n +6 
        n->∞ 

        lim   (5/n^2)/(1 +6/n^2) 
        n->∞ 

        lim   0 + 0/ 1 + 0 + 0 
        n->∞ 

              = 0 , So the function f(n) is growing fast.

* Direct Way to reduce Order of Growth

-Ignore Lower order terms.
-Ignore Leading constant              

*How we know which term are lower oerder?

-c < loglogn < logn < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < n^n


2.Asysptotic Notations

-Big O: Represnts exact bound or upper bound.
-Thetha: Represnts exact bound.
-Omega: Represnts exact or lower bound.
